go to flaskapp
open terminal on flaskapp
run : pyhon3 main.py or gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:4000 main:app --reload

open the browser 142.93.21.67:3000
open also 142.93.21.67:3000/aboutus
and see what happen and try to figure out what is going on
you will notice each function correspond to a route or an address or a webpage

we need to do more functionality:
restful api with flask
postman for testing our app
template and how to send
